Vacancy page for football with admin, player and team credentials

On this website, I am looking to create a job search for players and teams 

Players can make a profile with their details and possibly upload clips of them playing football

They can apply for vacancies made by teams in their position

They can apply for trials that teams can upload for their team

Teams can upload a profile with details of their time of training, facilities and location

They can also upload vacancies for positions

They can also upload a date to hold trials that players can enter for

An explore page is available to find suggested vacancies related to your registered position on the site

Reccomended players is positions you have made vacancies for as a team will be suggested from the team pov on the explore page

Players can upload highlights of themselves playing which will be on their profile and the explore page

Players can also follow teams on the site, teams can follow players

Admin can ban players if their highlights are fake

Admin can ban teams if the team is fake
